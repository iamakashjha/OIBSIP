This repository is related to my Data Science internship with **Oasis Infobyte**.

**In this repository, I've completed 3 projects as mentioned below:**

## 1. Iris Flower Classification
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. We have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here I've trained a machine learning model that can classify them based on their measurement of Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

## 2. Car Price Prediction with ML
Car price prediction is a significant area of research in machine learning, aiming to forecast the price of a car based on various factors such as brand goodwill, car features, Selling_Price, Driven_kms, and more. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately predict car prices using relevant features.

**Project Goals:**
Build a machine learning model capable of predicting car prices with high accuracy.
Identify the key features that significantly influence car prices.
Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques.

## 3. Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam. I have performed data cleaning, EDA, and applied the Naive Bayes classifier on this data with 3 different classification algorithms, Successfully predicting results with 98% accuracy.
